# The Pursuit of Happiness: Between Fiction and Reality 🌍✨

This project explores the socio-economic drivers of global happiness by integrating data from the **World Happiness Report** (2015-2019) with the **Human Freedom Index** (2022). 

The goal is to determine which factors, ranging from economic wealth to individual freedoms, have the strongest impact on perceived well-being.

*Developed as a final project for the **Data Manipulation and Visualization** module during the course in **Data Science** at Start2Impact University in 2024.*

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Data Integration:** Merging multi-year datasets with inconsistent structures into a unified analytical framework.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating distributions, identifying outliers, and analyzing skewness and kurtosis.
* **Network Analysis:** Visualizing the complex interconnections between happiness scores and freedom indices using graph theory.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Implementing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to quantify the predictive power of different variables.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy
* **Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly (Interactive charts)
* **Advanced Analytics:** NetworkX (Network Graphs), Statsmodels, Scikit-learn (Statistical modeling & Regression)
